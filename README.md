# Hi and welcome! ðŸ’»

I am a first year computer science student and I live in France! I am interested in all areas of computer science, although I have a small preference for software development. I work mainly on projects that can be very diverse. On one hand, I work on small projects that take less than 2 hours, on the other hand I also work on long projects like a video game in C++.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ! HTML/CSS/JS/PHP, C/C++, Python...

## If you want to discover my work, look at these three projects ðŸ‘€
[Skalefou/small-algorithm](https://github.com/Skalefou/small-algorithm) - Various algorithms of all kinds!

[Skalefou/Firefighter](https://github.com/Skalefou/Firefighter) - Maze game in C++ (under development)
